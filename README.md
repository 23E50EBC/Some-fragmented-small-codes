作者是学计算机的，大学过程中编写了一些很有趣的小代码，现在放到这里供大家参考，襟怀浅狭，俟教高明。
The author is a computer science student, and during my college years, I wrote some very interesting little codes. Now I am uploading them here for everyone's reference. Please forgive my vulgar literary skills and inadequate coding level. I look forward to more skilled experts giving opinions and suggestions on my code
